<h1>The Instant Messenger Kit </h1>


<br>


<h2>Configuring the Instant Messenger </h2>


<p>To use the IM Kit, you will need an account on one or more of the IM services that we support. The IM kit is not capable of creating accounts for any of the protocols. To edit your settings for the Instant Messenger Kit and the installed 
  protocol(s), right-click the im_kit's replicant in the Deskbar and 
  select Settings.</p>
<br>
<h3>Server</h3>
<h4>im_server</h4>
<p><img src="graphics/imkit-preferences-im_server.png" alt="imkit-preferences-im_server" width="491" height="296"></p>
<p>The IM kit can be set to start up with your system. This can be 
  done in two ways, by adding a shortcut of im_server to ZETA's <em>Autostart</em> folder or by simply checking <em>Auto-Start</em> for both the im_client, 
  im_logger and im_server in the IM preferences.</p>
<p>Activating the <em>Blink Deskbar icon<i> </i></em>option will make 
  the IM kit's Deskbar replicant blink when you receive an instant 
  message. For the Deskbar replicant to be able to blink you will 
  first have to activate <i>Show icon in Deskbar</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Debug log threshold</i> can be set to <i>High</i>.</p>
<p>An <i>Away Message</i> can be set system wide for all protocols, 
  but you can also set an unique away message for each protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Protocols</h3>
<p>In the IM Server settings click on the protocol you want to edit.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/imkit-preferences-yahoo.png" alt="imkit-preferences-yahoo" width="491" height="296"></p>
<h4>Yahoo!</h4>
<p>Yahoo! has made their own instant messaging client and protocol. 
  To use the protocol under the IM kit, you will have to have a generic 
  &quot;Yahoo! ID&quot; that let you make use of their services (mail, 
  im, calendar and more). There is also a standalone Yahoo! Messenger (BeY!) for ZETA available on <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/4161">BeBits</a>. </p>
<p><img src="graphics/imkit-preferences-msn.png" alt="imkit-preferences-msn" width="492" height="297"></p>
<h4>MSN</h4>
<p>The MSN Messenger is an instant messaging system developed by Microsoft, 
  that works together their Passport system. The Instant Messenger 
  kit has partial support for this protocol, as you can only send 
  and receive messages with this protocol implementation. To make 
  use of this protocol you will have to have a <em>Passport Email</em>. 
  Most people use their hotmail address, but also other e-mail addresses 
  can be used. Add your Passport <em>Password</em> and a <em>Display 
    Name</em>. </p>
<p>When it comes to the MSN protocol there are two standalone applications 
  available, <em> <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/4032">MSN ++</a> </em>and <em><a href="http://bme.sourceforge.net/">Bme</a>.</em></p>
<p><img src="graphics/imkit-preferences-jabber.png" alt="imkit-preferences-jabber" width="491" height="297"></p>
<h4>Jabber</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a> is a set of streaming 
  XML protocols and technologies that enable any two entities on the 
  Internet to exchange messages, presence and other structured information. 
  Username and Password is added as for the other supported protocols.</p>
<p> What differs the Jabber protocol compared to the other protocols, 
  is that you also have to add information about the server that you 
  want to use. There are tens of thousands of Jabber servers running 
  today, and millions of people use Jabber for IM. These servers can 
  either be a private Jabber network or a public server. The jabberd 
  server software makes the architecture of the Jabber network similar 
  to e-mail. This is currently one of the few protocols that enable 
  individuals and organizations to take control of their IM experience. 
  If your company is running Zeta on your desktop computers and you 
  are in the need of an IM server, then jabberd should be your choice.</p>
<p>A list of available IM servers are available on Jabber web site.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/imkit-preferences-icq.png" alt="imkit-preferences-icq" width="493" height="295"></p>
<h4>ICQ</h4>
<p>The ICQ protocol was the first supported protocol in the IM kit. 
  ICQ is a play of the phrase &quot;<em>I seek you</em>&quot;. To 
  use the ICQ protocol, you will need an <a href="http://www.icq.com/">ICQ 
    account</a>. ICQ users are indetified by numbers (UIN) instead of 
  usernames. In the ICQ settings you will find fields for adding your <em>UIN</em>, <em>Password</em>, and choose your prefered <i>Text 
    encoding</i>.</p>
<p>The default text encoding is <i>UTF-8</i>. For European users we 
  recommend <i>ISO 8859-1</i>, as it is commonly used for the following 
  languages: Albanian, Basque, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Faroese, 
  French (missing only &oelig;), Finnish, German, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, 
  Norwegian, Portuguese, Rhaeto-Romanic, Scottish, Spanish and Swedish. 
  The <i>JIS</i> encoding refers to several Japanese Industrial Standards 
  for encoding the Japanese language. <i>Shift-JIS</i> is a character 
  encoding for the Japanese language developed by Microsoft. EUC (Extended 
  Unix Coding) is an 8-bit character encoding used primarily for Japanese 
  and Korean. The last supported encoding Windows 1251, is an 8-bit 
  character encoding, designed to cover languages that use the Cyrillic 
  alphabet such as Russian and other languages. </p>
<p>For information about the various input_servers available for Zeta, 
  please read the article <a href="../../../../system/input-server.html">How 
    to use Input Servers in Zeta</a>.</p>
<p>To activate the changes you have made, press Save.</p>

<h4>Google Talk </h4>
<p>Google Talk is a popular, lightweight <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>-based  instant messaging client with voice capabilities, currently only  available for Windows. But as it is based on the open Jabber (XMPP)  protocol, you can chat with friends having Google Talk from other  third party IM clients, including the IM kit. </p>
<p><img src="graphics/imkit-preferences-aim.png" alt="imkit-preferences-aim" width="491" height="298"></p>
<h4>AIM</h4>
<p>If you want to start using the AIM protocol, you will have to register 
  at <a href="http://www.aim.com/">http://www.aim.com/</a>. When registered, 
  you will have your Screen Name and a Password, which you can add 
  to this preflet. </p>
<p>Information for the User Profile is optional. User profiles provide 
  a way for individuals to share backgrounds and opinions with the 
  community, and is a nice way to show that you are a Zeta user. </p>
<p>After having added the information you want for the AIM protocol, 
  press Save to activate the protocol. The AIM protocol is called 
  OSCAR (Open System for CommunicAtion in Realtime), and is the same 
  protocol that also ICQ makes use of.</p>
<p>For more information about using the AIM protocol under Zeta, please 
  read the <a href="../beaim.html">BeAIM article</a>.</p>

<h3>Clients</h3>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>im_binlogger</h4>
<p>The im_binlogger collecting up the bmessages that are sent between the im_server and the client of your choice, and writing them to logs for each person that you are having registered an IM protocol on. These logs can be read with the <a href="utilities.html">im_binlog_viewer</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>im_logger</h4>
<p>im_logger is listening to the IM kit applications and writing them to a simple text file found in your home folder (im_kit.log). You will for instance see all the errors that appears the IM Kit here. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>im_infopopper</h4>
<p>The small tool <a href="../../info-popper.html">InfoPopper</a> first started as part of the IM kit. The IM kit has it's own settings 
  for these pop-ups. You can here edit the way that the information 
  is presented you on the screen. The InfoPopper window can contain 
  an icon. As the icons are in SVG, you can set the prefered size 
  on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>im_client</h4>
<p>The im_client<em> </em> has a <em>Menubar</em> containing scalable 
  icons. The default size is set to 32 pixels, but if you have a high 
  screen resolution, you might want to set the <em>Icon</em> <em>Size</em> to 48 or even 64 pixels.</p>
<p>The im_client has by default both <em>Show 'Send' button</em> and <em>Send messages with CMD-Enter instead of Enter</em> activated.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/im-client-settings.png" width="495" height="299"></p>
<p>As mentioned above you can <i>Auto-start</i> the im_logger together 
  with the im_server and im_client during the system startup.</p>
