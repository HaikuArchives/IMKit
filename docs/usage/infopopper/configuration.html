The German developer J&ouml;rn Weigend from <a href="http://www.team-maui.de">Team-Maui</a> has
developed a graphical frontend to the InfoPopper settings. The
InfoPopper is mainly updated with three slidebars. <br>

<br>

The maximum window
width is automatically set to the same as your horizontal screen
resolution. In the screenshot below it is set to 1024, which is equals
the XGA resolution. The limitation is only done in this graphical
frontend, so that you never define the InfoPopper to cover the Deskbar.
By default the window width is set to 300 pixels. <br>

<br>

The second slider is
for setting the Standard display time, which can be overwritten by the
applications with InfoPopper support. By default it is set to 10
seconds, but <a href="applications.html#SoundPlay">SoundPlay</a> for instance has the option displaying it as
long as music is played. <br>

<br>

The third and last slider is a must. By
default it is set to as low as 16x16 pixels. That's not much for icons,
and even worse for album covers and pictures of your buddies using AIM
for chatting! <br>

<br>

For all three sliders there has been implemented labels
describing what you are about to change. <br>

<br>

Instead of using the sliders
you can simply just type in the wanted size in the fields right to the
sliders.<br>


<br>

<br>


For each change you do with the sliders you can see the changes by
pressing the button. A preview InfoPopper will then appear, showing the set
sizes. InfoPopper Settings also let you set if you want to have the
title above the icon or to the right of the icon. This change can only
be seen in the Preview window when the icon size is set to 40 or higher.<br>

The developer of this graphical frontend and JABA just loves easter
eggs, so just you look for them!<br>


<br>


InfoPopper's configuration file can be found at
<span style="font-style: italic;">/boot/home/config/settings/BeClan/infopopper/</span>, and can also be edited
with QuickRes:<br>


<br>


<img src="gfx/infopopper-settings-quickres.png" height="354" width="535"><br>


<br>


From within QuickRes you can easily change the size of the InfoPopper
window, the display time, the title position and at last the icon size.
By default the display time is set to 5 seconds and the icon size to
16.
