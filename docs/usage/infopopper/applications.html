<p>There are already several applications supporting the
InfoPopper. If your application is not listed, please contact us. We
have also made a <a href="developers.html">Developers</a>
section describing you in detail how you can add support for InfoPopper
in your applications. </p>

<h3><img src="gfx/imkit.png" align="left" height="128" width="128"><a name="The_Instant_Messenger_Kit"></a>The Instant
Messenger Kit</h3>






<p> The <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/3914">IM
kit</a> can parse messages to InfoPopper that shows you when one
of your buddies goes online/offline, changes status to available/away
and with what protocol your buddy is connected with.</p>





<p><img style="width: 423px; height: 131px;" alt="" src="gfx/infopopper-msn-login.png"></p>





<p>
InfoPopper is also showing information when you are logging in with the
IM kit. It will show the login process for each protocol that you have
configured and then straight afterwards your online buddies with their
statuses.<br>






<br>






<img src="gfx/buddy-icon.png" height="105" width="306">
<br>






<br>






For the AIM protocol InfoPopper will also show your friends' buddy
icons. On the screenshot a picture of our project leader changing his
online status to <em>Away</em> for the AOL Instant
Messenger (AIM) protocol.</p>






<p>Clicking on the InfoPopper when one of your buddies changes
his/her status or send you a message, will open the relevant contact's
chat window, so that you can start a chat with that person.</p>

  <p>IconSetter utility - </p>






  <p>It lets you set the icon for a person and a protocol. <br>
    slaad eg. build/utils/IconSetter /home/people/frankps &quot;general&quot; 
    /boot/home/Desktop/frank.jpg</p>
  <p>The im_infopopper will look for an icon for the protocol a message comes 
    from (eg. &quot;aim&quot;). If it can't find one it will look for the general 
    one (&quot;general&quot;). If it still can't find one it uses the protocol 
    icon.</p>

<p><img src="gfx/info-popper-rss.png" height="340" width="416"><br>






<br>






The RSS kit has not been released yet, and is developed by <a href="team.html">Michael Davidson</a>. </p>

<h3><img src="gfx/mail.png" align="left" height="128" width="128"><a name="The_Mail_Kit"></a>The
Mail Daemon Replacement (MDR) Kit</h3>






  
<p> InfoPopper is also capable of showing notifications of new e-mails received 
    with the <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/2289">Mail Daemon Replacement 
    (MDR) kit</a>. Rumors are that also future versions of <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/2763">Beam</a> 
    will be able to parse messages to the InfoPopper.<br>




    <br>




    To make the InfoPopper notify you about new incoming e-mails, go to the Preferences 
    in MDR. For each e-mail account that you have configured, open <em>E-mail 
    Filters</em> settings, and then choose <em>Incoming E-mail Filters</em> in 
    the first pop-down menu and <em>infopopperdisplay</em> in the second pop-down 
    menu.<br>




    <br>




    <img src="gfx/infopopperdisplay.png" height="479" width="458"><br>




    <br>




    You will then see <em>Send message to InfoPopper</em> in the window over activated 
    filters. InfoPopper can of course run next to other filters.<br>




    <br>




    <img src="gfx/infopopper-incoming-mail.png" height="112" width="303"> <br>




    <br>




    After you have activated the infopopperdisplay filter in MDR, InfoPopper will 
    show you new incoming e-mails as the arrive on your system. InfoPopper will 
    display the sending e-mail address and the topic of the e-mail. Clicking on 
    a message shown in InfoPopper, will open that e-mail client that comes with 
    MDR.</p>
<p><img style="width: 308px; height: 114px;" alt="" src="gfx/infopopper-gravatar.png"></p>
  <p>When you are receiving new e-mails, the MDR plugin will look for the Person 
    file who sent you an email and use their &quot;general&quot; icon. The plugin 
    looks at the <em>From</em> email address. It queries for People files with 
    an email matching that. If it finds it, it gets their &quot;general&quot; 
    icon and displays that. </p>
  <p>For now you'll need to use the IconSetter utility to set the &quot;general&quot; 
    icon for a Person. If it cannot find a Person to match to the email, or the 
    Person doesn't have a &quot;general&quot; icon, then the mail icon is used 
    (like it was before). This works for any incoming mail, so you might set up 
    a Person to represent the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">Dictionary.com</a> 
    <a href="http://signup.dictionary.com/wordoftheday">word of the day</a> and 
    have their &quot;general&quot; icon be that of a Dictionary</p>

<img src="gfx/vision.png" align="left" height="128" width="128"><a name="Vision"></a>Vision</h3>






<p> <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/2623">Vision</a>
is the default IRC client in Zeta. For a better user experience this
IRC client has a Notify List below the server and channel list on the
left side of the application's main window.<br>






<br>






With InfoPopper you will be able to get better notifications on when
your friends are coming online and when they are going offline. Further
you will see messages containing your nickname.<br>

<h3> <img src="gfx/soundplay-icon.png" align="left" height="128" width="128"><a name="SoundPlay"></a>SoundPlay</h3>






  
<p> <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/156">SoundPlay</a> users can enjoy that 
    InfoPopper shows them information about the current song being played. The 
    tool shows you the album cover (48x48) - so called coverart, which in this 
    case is the album h&ocirc;tel costes 7 by Stephane Pompougnac. The track in 
    this case is called Sunday Driver and Soundplay has played 42 % of the track). 
  </p>






<p>Of more technical information, SoundPlay shows you what the
pitch has been set to and bitrate the track has been encoded in to.<br>






<br>






<img src="gfx/infopopper-soundplay.png" height="126" width="303"><br>






<br>






The album covers are automatically downloaded from Amazon.com, and are
locally stored in the folder <em>~/config/settings/BeClan/InfoPopper/SoundPlay/AlbumCovers</em>.
From time to time, you will find that <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> hasn't got the
album or made available a picture of the album, you can then save a
picture of the album on the form {Artist}_{Album} .<br>

<h3> <img src="gfx/beshare.png" align="left" height="128" width="128"><a name="BeShare"></a>BeShare</h3>






<p> A demo implementation of InfoPopper support in <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/1330">BeShare</a> has
been done by one of yellowTAB's developers, Fran&ccedil;ois Revol.
His version is only available on the Tycom BeShare server, and is
capable of parsing information when a download has been completed, when
your nickname get mentioned in the main chat window and when somebody
writes you a private message.<br>
