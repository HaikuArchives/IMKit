<h2>Introduction</h2>


<div class="quotbox">
<p>The developer team is constantly looking for new members. If
you want to contribute, please don't hesitate to contact us or simply
just join us on our IRC channel #beosimkit on irc.freenode.org</p>


<p>As we are all using ZETA, we hope that there are someone that
can help us out with compiling a BeOS version of InfoPopper.</p>

<p><img src="gfx/infopopper-logo.png" align="left" height="128" width="128">The InfoPopper is a system
wide notification system for ZETA. Any application can send a
notification to InfoPopper which then will display a message next to
the Deskbar. If you have an application that you would like to add
InfoPopper support to, please take a look at the <a href="developers.html">Developers</a> section.</p>


<p>InfoPopper is being developed by the developer team that also
does the <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/3914">BeOS
Instant Messenger kit</a>, and the notification server started
just as a small tool part of the Instant Messenger Kit. It later got
taken out of the IM kit and was made in to a separate application. The
first version of the InfoPopper was limited to notifications over
received instant messages and status changes on your buddies. Today's
InfoPopper is capable of notifying you when you receive e-mails,
updates of your favourite web sites that carries RSS feeds and when you
get a message in <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/2623">Vision</a>
or when some of your buddies the Notify List in Vision go
online/offline. But also other <a href="applications.html">applications</a>
have InfoPopper support. </p>


<p>Be aware that some of the applications that have InfoPopper
support are only available for ZETA. Also, the SVG icons and the
localization&nbsp;are only
available in the ZETA version of InfoPopper. ZETA comes with an
Appearence preference applications that lets you set the color to the
system and some applications, one of them is of cource InfoPopper:</p>
