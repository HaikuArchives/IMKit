<h2>Setting Your Status </h2>


<p>Anyone using ZETA that has made a People file about you with the 
  your nickname on the supported protocols as attributes, or friends 
  using other platforms that has added you to their buddy lists, can 
  see when you are logged in and what status you have set. Setting 
  your status as <em>Available</em>, is an invitation for others to 
  start a chat with you. 
</p>
<p>The <em>im_server</em> lets you can set your online status for 
  all protocols at once using it's replicant in the Deskbar menu, 
  but you can also choose which protocol you want to be available 
  with:</p>

<p>Currently only three different status modes are supported: <em>Available</em> (Online), <em>Away</em> and <em>Offline</em>. The kit lets you set 
  a different status for each protocol if needed:</p>

<p>You can easily check your online status by by moving the mouse 
  over the deskbar replicant. A label will then appear on the screen 
  showing the status of each installed protocol: </p>

<p>Our tip is that you switch your status from Available (green) to 
  Away (yellow) when you need to get some work done. This way you 
  are able to get the work done without being disturbed with unnecessary 
  messages, but still being able to send messages related to your 
  work.</p>
