<p><img src="infopopper/gfx/infopopper-logo.png" align="left" height="128" width="128">The Instant Messenger kit (IM kit) is a multi-platform instant 
              messaging client, and the purpose of the kit is to provide a uniform 
              way to access the various instant messenger networks that exist, and to provide 
              a connection between a People file and the instant messenger accounts that a person 
              has.<br>
              <br>
The IM Kit is a modular framework developed to make it easy to access 
              the five most commonly used IM networks: AIM, Google Talk, ICQ, Jabber, MSN and Yahoo!, and is designed in a way that fully integrates it with ZETA. 
              It makes use of ZETA attributes, indexes and live queries to make 
              it as flexible as possible. With the IM Kit you can, for instance, 
              search for all members of your family that are online and that by 
              using the standard Find interface in the operating system. You can also manage all the contacts 
  by using the Tracker.</p>

<p>The close integration with the Tracker, makes it real easy to integrate the online status of contacts in to other applications, examples are the small system application <a href="infopopper/index.html">InfoPopper</a>, Deskbar and the project management application TimeZliner. 
  Seeing that some of your project workers are online when you work 
  on the project management file, means that you don't waste time 
  on composing emails when a few minutes chat would answer your questions 
  straight away.</p>

<h3>How the Instant Messenger Kit works</h3>
<p> When you start the IM kit and log in to the protocols you have 
  accounts for, the IM kit will connect to these IM networks, which 
  directs the chat traffic between all ZETA users and users on other 
  platforms using one of these protocols. What makes instant messaging 
  so great compared to e-mail, is that the conversations happen in 
  realtime.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/imkit-infopopper-gtalk.png" alt="imkit-infopopper" width="426" height="253"></p>
<p>When the IM kit is running, the application <a href="infopopper/index.html">InfoPopper</a> will constantly be checking with the activated networks to see if 
  any of your friends are online, what their statuses are, and if 
  they're typing/sending you messages. When you or one of your friends 
  initiates a chat, the activated servers connect your client applications 
  so you can send messages to each others. InfoPopper can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.bebits.com/app/4163">BeBits</a>, but is also part of ZETA 1.1. </p>

<h3>Sound events </h3>
<p>The IM kit adds a number of new sound events that you can assign 
  sounds to in the Sounds preflet in the Preferences in ZETA. A nice little 8-bit collection of sounds has 
  been installed in <i>/boot/apps/im_kit/sounds</i> if you don't have 
  sounds of your own to use. </p>
