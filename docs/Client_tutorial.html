<h1>IM Kit: How to write a client</h1>

<p>First of all, a quick introduction to the structure of the kit: In the beginning, there is the im_server.
Then the im_server loads the protocol add-ons, and starts the auto-start clients. When this is all well
and done, the clients can start telling the im_server what to do. They do this with the help of plain
ol' BMessages and a helping hand called IM::Manager. The IM::Manager sends messages to the im_server,
and it also let's the clients add endpoints for listening to messages from the im_server.</p>

<p><strong>So what do you -really- need to do to write a client?</strong> Well, it depends on what you want
to do with your client. If all you want to do is to send a single message to someone, all you have to do is
to link against libim.so and use IM::Manager.OneShotMessage() to send a carefully constructed message. If you
want to do more than just send single messages, you should have a BHandler attached to a BLooper and use
IM::Manager to add that handler as an endpoint. That means that every message that the im_server get's (sort of)
is forwarded to your handler. Then it's up to you what you want to do with these messages. Most of them you'll
probably ignore, since they're not of interest to you client, but now and again there will come a message that
you want to act upon, and this tutorial will show you how!</p>

<h2>Step 1: Spawn a BLooper and add a BHandler</h2>

<p>If this sounds tricky, it isn't. You can use your be_app or one of your windows if you don't want to create
a new looper/handler just for IM messages.</p>

<pre><code>
	class IMApp : public BApplication
	{
		// Fleshed out below..
	};
	
	int main()
	{
		IMApp * app = new IMApp;
		app->Run();
	}
</code></pre>

<h2>Step 2: Tell the im_server you want to listen</h2>

<p>This is darn easy as well, just have a look:</p>

<pre><code>
	#include &lt;libim/Manager.h&gt;
	
	class IMApp : public BApplication
	{
		private:
			IM::Manager * fManager;
		
		public:
			IMApp()
			:	BApplication("application/x-vnd.beclan.im_client_tutorial")
			{
			};
			
			void ReadyToRun()
			{
				fManager = new IM::Manager(this);
				
				fManager->StartListening();
			};
	};
</code></pre>

<p>That wasn't so hard, was it? Now all we have to do is start paying attention to the messages we receive!</p>

<h2>Step 3: Act on the messages</h2>

<p>The IM messages are like any other messages, so we'll add some code to MessageReceived() to do this.</p>

<pre><code>
	#include &lt;libim/Constants.h&gt;
	
	class IMApp : public BApplication
	{
		void MessageReceived( BMessage * msg )
		{
			switch ( msg->what )
			{
				case IM::Message:
				{
					int32 im_what=0;
					
					if ( msg->FindInt32("im_what", &im_what) != B_OK )
						// Invalid message. Shouldn't happen, but we make sure.
						break;
					
					switch ( im_what )
					{
						case IM::MESSAGE_RECEIVED:
						{ // a message has been received. Let's send a reply!
							entry_ref contact;
							
							// Get an entry_ref to the source of the message
							if ( msg->FindRef("contact", &contact) != B_OK )
								// again, should never happen.
								break;
							
							// Construct the reply, adding the contact so the im_server knows
							// who to send it to
							BMessage reply(IM::MESSAGE);
							reply.AddInt32("im_what", IM::SEND_MESSAGE);
							reply.AddRef("contact", &contact);
							reply.AddString("message", "This is an automatic reply. Cool, huh?");
							
							fManager->SendMessage( &reply );
						}	break;
						
						default:
							break;
					}
					
				}	break;
				
				default:
					BApplication::MessageReceived(msg);
					break;
			}
		};
	};
</code></pre>

<p>Phew, that got a bit more involed, didn't it? Well, that's what you get for using C++, it's pretty chatty with all
those curly braces all over the place. Let's go through the important steps one by one:</p>

<ol>
	<li><code>#include &lt;libim/Constants.h&gt;</code>: Include this header to get the definitions of all those IM constants.</li>

	<li><code>case IM::MESSAGE:</code>: in MessageReceived, check for IM::MESSAGE.</li>

	<li><code>msg->FindInt32("im_what", &amp;im_what)</code>: Extract the im_what code.</li>

	<li><code>msg->FindRef("contact", &contact)</code>: Get an entry_ref for the relevant contact.</li>

	<li><code><pre>BMessage reply(IM::MESSAGE);
reply.AddInt32("im_what", IM::SEND_MESSAGE);
reply.AddRef("contact", &contact);
reply.AddString("message", "This is an automatic reply. Cool, huh?");</pre></code>Construct a message in accordance to
the <a href="IM_Message.html">message definitions</a>.</li>

	<li><code>fManager->SendMessage( &reply );</code>: Send the message to the im_server. Done!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Step 4: No, you're done</h2>

<p>That's pretty much all you have to do to send messages to anyone in the world. Not too hard, was it?</p>

<p>Now that you've gotten your feet wet, you can check out what other messages you can send and receive, and
what they do. You will find this information over at the <a href="IM_Message.html">message definitions</a>.</p>
