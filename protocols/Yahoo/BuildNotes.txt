You need to fetch and install libyahoo2.

http://libyahoo2.sf.net/

We've been using 0.7.5, not sure if other versions will work.

To get it to build you need to fiddle a bit with libyahoo2's makefile.

Start by running this in a Terminal where you've unpacked the lib source:

	configure --prefix=/boot/home/config  --with-struct-callbacks

Then edit src/Makefile:
	
	* R5:
		Change the line:
			LIBS =  $(GLIB_LIBS)
		to
			LIBS =  $(GLIB_LIBS) -lbind -lsocket
	* Zeta:
		where it says -lsocket, also add -lbind on the same line, right after -lsocket.
	* Haiku:
		Change the line:
			LIBS =  $(GLIB_LIBS)
		to
			LIBS =  $(GLIB_LIBS) -lnetwork
	
	* remove "-ansi -pedantic" from the CFLAGS line

	* change the line:
		LINK = $(LIBTOOL) --mode=link $(CCLD) $(AM_CFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) \
	to:
		LINK = $(LIBTOOL) --mode=link $(CCLD) -no-undefined  $(AM_CFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) \

Edit src/sample_client.c, line 1020: 

	change (socklen_t*) to (int*)

Then you should be able to run "make ; make install", after which the Yahoo add-on
should compile.
