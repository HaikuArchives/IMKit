To build the MSN add-on you need to fetch, build and install OpenSSL:
http://www.openssl.org/

The prebuilt version on BeBits, http://www.bebits.com/app/1020 , should also work.

If you installed the prebuilt version on BeBits,
navigate to  /boot/home/config/lib/ and:
* make a symlink of libssl.so.0.9.7  to libssl.so  
* make a symlink of libcrypto.so.0.9.7  to libcrypto.so
