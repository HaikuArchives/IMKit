To build the GoogleTalk add-on you need to fetch, build and install OpenSSL:
http://www.openssl.org/

The prebuilt version on BeBits, http://www.bebits.com/app/1020 , should also work.

note:
  *running `imkit/make` will enure OpenSSL is symlinked properly.


If you installed the prebuilt version on BeBits,
navigate to  /boot/home/config/lib/ and:
* make a symlink of libssl.so.0.9.7  to libssl.so  
* make a symlink of libcrypto.so.0.9.7  to libcrypto.so  
* make a symlink of libcrypto.so.0.9.7  to /boot/develop/lib/x86/libcrypto.so  
* make a symlink of /boot/home/config/include/openssl  (the folder)  to /boot/develop/headers/openssl
