IM Kit - Building within Haiku source tree
==========================================

Put IM Kit source code into $HAIKUDIR/3rdparty/IMKit, where $HAIKUDIR is Haiku
source code directory.

Check it out with the usual method:

$ cd $HAIKUDIR/3rdparty
$ svn checkout http://svn.osdrawer.net/imkit/trunk IMKit

== Enabling Open SSL ==

If you want to build GoogleTalk and MSN you would need the OpenSSL optional package.
Add the following lines to $HAIKUDIR/build/jam/UserBuildConfig:

AddOptionalHaikuImagePackages OpenSSL ;

== Enabling InfoPopper client ==

If you want to build InfoPopper on the Haiku image, check it out:

$ cd $HAIKUDIR/3rdparty
$ svn checkout http://svn.osdrawer.net/infopopper/trunk InfoPopper

Create a link on your IMKit dir mentioned above to the InfoPopper headers dir:

ln -sf ../InfoPopper/libinfopopper infopopper

Append those lines to your $HAIKUDIR/build/jam/UserBuildConfig:

IMKIT_HAVE_INFOPOPPER = 1 ;
DeferredSubInclude HAIKU_TOP 3rdparty InfoPopper : Jamfile.haiku ;

== Building ==

Your $HAIKUDIR/build/jam/UserBuildConfig must have this line at the end:

DeferredSubInclude HAIKU_TOP 3rdparty IMKit : Jamfile.haiku ;

Now build the image as usual:

$ cd $HAIKUDIR
$ jam -q

You can also create a zip archive with your nightly builds:

$ jam -q imkit-cvs
