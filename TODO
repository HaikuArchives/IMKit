This is a list of bugs that need to be fixed, features that have been requested and such. If you
feel like coding something and don't know what to do, this is the place to go! :)

Please visit the BeClan bug tracker, since I'm moving all this over there.

___ Things to fix

* Protocol doc needs to be updated and extended to describe Deskbar add-on and probably more.
* Strangeness with getting contact info, error in icq-addon or in im_server, or both?
* Add Deskbar monitor for im_server, so it restores the deskbar icon if needed.
* Don't use BAlert in Merge contacts, it doesn't play well with long filenames
* Contact's BNode::SetTo crashes with invalid pointer sometimes?
* Change 'command sends message' option to a one-of-two menu
* Make the clients handle the new 'multiple contacts per message' thing
* Fix im_server SVG icon setting so it doesn't have to read the icons all the time..
* binlog viewer: auto-wrap long lines, if we support variable height list items?
* Add to readme/documentation, german docs: http://besly.mittilgart.de
* im_server: ContactMonitor_Modified, merging "online" > "offline". Several AIM.
* im_server: what happens in the index test if we have a read-only BFS volume mounted?
* im_server: remove all FindContact calls and replace with FindAllContacts

___ New features

Re-add libbsvg code for R5 SVG support

Setting something so ICQ displays as online with it's webfeatures

Support for wide char encodings (utf-16 etc)?
	Need to move all text to data fields instead of string ones, lots of work.

Auto-send a user defined message to blocked contacts if they send a message (don't send again
if already sent in the last 30 seconds, to prevent ping pong flood)

Change Merge contacts, or make a new one, so it can be used from the Terminal

Invisibility

More attributes for info like timezone, location, etc?

Option for im_server - Don't fetch serverside contact lists

* More possible statuses, like Busy etc. Separate into sub-status? Away:Working, Away:Busy etc
* Add a new attribute, IM Specific Status, for network-specific status (well, d'uh.)
For things like "out to lunch" or whatever messages you can set on e.g. MSN.

Serverside contact list manager:
	Search for contacts
		IM:SEARCH_FOR_CONTACTS ( string:name, string:nick, string:email, string:id )
		IM:SEARCH_RESULTS ( protocol, name, email, id, whatever info we can get )
		IM:SEARCH_COMPLETED (protocol)
		IM:STOP_SEARCH (stops the currently active search(?))
	Remove contacts
		IM:REMOVE_SERVERSIDE_CONTACT (protocol, id)
	Sort contacts in groups
		IM:GET_SERVERSIDE_GROUPS (protocol)
		IM:GET_CONTACTS_IN_SERVERSIDE_GROUP (protocol, group)
		IM:MOVE_CONTACT_TO_SERVERSIDE_GROUP (protocol, id, group)

New client: Relay station
* Forward all messages received from !relay_target to relay_target

Features in sample_client
* Smileys
