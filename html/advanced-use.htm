<h3>Live Queries</h3>



<p>BeOS IM kit makes use of Queries and Attributes. In this part of the manual, 
  we want to show you how you can construct your own queries for this chat solution.</p>
<p>Go to the Deskbar and choose Find, or hit Alt + F in a Tracker related window 
  or after first having clicked on the desktop.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/query.png" width="450" height="148"></p>
<p>In the Query application, choose what file type you want to be searched by 
  clicking on <i>All files and folders</i>. In this pop-down menu, first choose 
  application, and from the application's sub-menu, choose Person. The Query we 
  want to do, is related to the Person files.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/im-query2.png" width="450" height="440"></p>
<p>Choose <i>By attribute</i> from the pop-down menu <i>Name</i> and then that 
  you only want to do the Query on your boot partition (here: Zeta). If you have 
  other BeOS systems on the computer, you can choose <em>All disks</em>.</p>
<p>As you set the Query type to attribute, a new pop-down menu appears and you 
  can choose between all attributes related to that file type. In the bottom of 
  this menu, you will find the attributes that you made when installing the Instant 
  Messenger kit, <i>IM Connections</i> and <i>IM Status</i>.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/im-query1.png" width="451" height="488"></p>
<p>Choose <i>IM Status</i>, and specify the query to be exact (Is). The exact 
  words that we want to do a query on are <i>Available</i>, <em>Away</em> and 
  <em>Offline</em>, and will show us all our friends that are using one of the 
  supported IM protocols. To get the query correct, each <em>IM Status</em> have 
  to be separated with <em>Or</em> (instead of the default <em>And</em>)..</p>
<p><img src="graphics/query-attributes.png" width="449" height="263"></p>
<p>If you find this query useful, you can save it for later use by giving it a 
  name and dragging the query icon to the desktop.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/live-query.png" width="280" height="444"></p>
<p>The Live Queries are system wide and can be seen in a various of applications 
  making use of the People files and in the operating system it self. In the <i>Recent 
  applications</i> you can also see with who you recently had a chat with and 
  the online status they have now, and start a new chat with them.</p>

<h3><br>
  Living on the Edge</h3>
<p>As the project is hosted by <a href="http://www.beclan.org">BeClan</a>, you 
  will need to install a <a href="http://www.beclan.org/packages/svn-0.33.pkg">subversion 
  client</a> to be able to download the sources and compile BeOS IM kit for your 
  self.</p>
<p>Open Terminal and type:</p>
<p><em>svn co http://www.beclan.org:8080/svn/repos/imkit/</em>, and the subversion 
  client will start downloading the sources.</p>
<p><img src="graphics/fetching-latest.png" width="600" height="445"></p>
<p>The sources are downloaded to <em>/boot/beos/home/imkit</em>. When the download 
  of the sources are completed, make sure that you are in the imkit folder and 
  then give the command <em>make</em>. The sources willl now get compiled, and 
  afterwards you can replace the old BeOS IM kit files with the new ones.</p>
